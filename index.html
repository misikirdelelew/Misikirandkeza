                Theoneste Nsanzabarinda and Eken, in fullAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                was born on October 15, 1931, in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
                He served as the 11th President
                of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
                Kalam earned a degree in
                aeronautical engineering from the
                Madras Institute of Technology and in
                1958 joined the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
                In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                Space Research Organisation, where he
                was project director of the SLV-III, the
                first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both designed and produced in India.
                <br>
                <br> Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                    “Missile Man.”</strong>
                <br>
                <br> Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in 1989.
